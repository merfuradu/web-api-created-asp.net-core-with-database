# ASP.NET Core Web API with PostgreSQL

## Overview

This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API that provides CRUD operations for managing personal data and associated addresses. The backend uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The database contains two tables: `PersonalData` and `Addresses`, which are related through a foreign key relationship.

## Features

- **Personal Data Management**: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete personal data records.
- **Address Management**: Supports operations for handling address records associated with personal data.
- **RESTful API**: Follows REST principles, making it easy to integrate with other systems.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Utilizes EF Core for database interactions, including querying and updating the PostgreSQL database.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for invalid requests, including invalid IDs and missing data.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and returns appropriate responses.
  - `PersonalDataController`: Manages operations related to personal data.
- **Models**: Defines the data structure used in the database.
  - `PersonalData`: Represents a person with fields like `Name`, `PhoneNumber`, and `AddressId`.
  - `Address`: Represents an address with fields like `Street`, `City`, `State`, and `PostalCode`.
- **Data**: Contains the database context which handles communication with the PostgreSQL database.
  - `TodoDb`: The database context that includes `DbSet<PersonalData>` and `DbSet<Address>` for interacting with the respective tables.

## Database

### PostgreSQL Database

The project uses PostgreSQL as the database. It contains two tables:

1. **PersonalData**:
   - `Id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each person.
   - `Name`: Name of the person.
   - `PhoneNumber`: Contact number of the person.
   - `IsComplete`: A boolean indicating if the record is complete.
   - `AddressId` (Foreign Key): Links to the `Address` table.

2. **Addresses**:
   - `Id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each address.
   - `Street`: Street information.
   - `City`: City information.
   - `State`: State information.
   - `PostalCode`: Postal code information.

### Relationships

- Each `PersonalData` entry is associated with one `Address` through the `AddressId` foreign key.
- The `Address` entity is a navigation property in the `PersonalData` model, allowing for easy access and manipulation of related address data.

## Endpoints

### Personal Data Endpoints

- **GET /api/PersonalData/GetPersonalDatas**: Retrieves all personal data entries.
- **GET /api/PersonalData/GetTodoById/{id}**: Retrieves a specific personal data entry by ID.
- **GET /api/PersonalData/GetPersonalDataByName/{name}**: Retrieves personal data entries by name.
- **POST /api/PersonalData/PostTodo**: Creates a new personal data entry.
- **PUT /api/PersonalData/PutTodo/{id}**: Updates an existing personal data entry by ID.
- **DELETE /api/PersonalData/DeleteTodo/{id}**: Deletes a personal data entry by ID.

### Address Endpoints

- **GET /api/Addresses/GetAddresses**: Retrieves all address entries.
- **GET /api/Addresses/GetAddressById/{id}**: Retrieves a specific address by ID.
- **POST /api/Addresses/PostAddress**: Creates a new address entry.
- **PUT /api/Addresses/PutAddress/{id}**: Updates an existing address entry by ID.
- **DELETE /api/Addresses/DeleteAddress/{id}**: Deletes an address entry by ID.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 7 SDK**: Required to build and run the API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. You will need to configure the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Configure the Database Connection**:
   - Open `appsettings.json`.
   - Update the connection string to point to your PostgreSQL database.

3. **Apply Migrations**:
   - Open the terminal in the project directory.
   - Run the following commands to apply migrations and create the database:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

4. **Run the API**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Test the API**:
   - You can use tools like Postman or Swagger UI (available at `http://localhost:<port>/swagger`) to interact with the API.

## Error Handling

- **Invalid ID Handling**: Returns a `400 Bad Request` if the provided ID is invalid.
- **Not Found**: Returns a `404 Not Found` if the requested resource does not exist.
- **Bad Request**: Returns a `400 Bad Request` if the input data is not valid.

## Improvements

- **Validation**: Add more robust validation rules for input data.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure the API by adding authentication and role-based authorization.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track API usage and errors.
- **Pagination**: Add pagination for `GET` requests to handle large datasets efficiently.
